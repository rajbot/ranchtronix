### Tymm's magic ball project
<pre>
-- i started with code from the winavr package, which might be in the
general gcc package; it's a pwm thing to dim one led up & down.  it uses
the 2313's built-in pwm... i changed it a bunch so it now uses the counter
to trigger interrupts at a set rate instead of using the built-in pwm and
uses an 8-bit normalized sin table for brightnesses of LED's hooked to
port B... so it's able to deal with 8 LED's at different brightness
levels instead of just 1; uses counters for each LED to deal with cycle
times.  this on a spin toy would probably look really cool :)
